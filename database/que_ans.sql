Shellfish include various species of molluscs (e.g. bivalve molluscs such as clams, oysters, and mussels, and cephalopods such as octopus and squid), crustaceans (e.g. shrimp, crabs, and lobster), and echinoderms (e.g. sea cucumbers and sea urchins).\r\nGroup	Image	Subgroup	Description	2010 production\r\n000 tonnes[14]\r\nfish	Fish are aquatic vertebrates which lack limbs with digits, use gills to breathe, and have heads protected by hard bone or cartilage skulls. See: Fish (food).Total for fish:  	106,639\r\nPelagic fish (Atlantic bluefin tuna)	marine\r\npelagic	Pelagic fish live and feed near the surface or in the water column of the sea, but not on the bottom of the sea. The main seafood groups can be divided into larger predator fish (sharks, tuna, billfish, mahi-mahi, mackerel, salmon) and smaller forage fish (herring, sardines, sprats, anchovies, menhaden). The smaller forage fish feed on plankton, and can accumulate toxins to a degree. The larger predator fish feed on the forage fish, and accumulate toxins to a much higher degree than the forage fish.	\r\n33,974\r\nDemersal fish (American plaice)	marine\r\ndemersal	Demersal fish live and feed on or near the bottom of the sea.[15] Some seafood groups are cod, flatfish, grouper and stingrays. Demersal fish feed mainly on crustaceans they find on the sea floor, and are more sedentary than the pelagic fish. Pelagic fish usually have the red flesh characteristic of the powerful swimming muscles they need, while demersal fish usually have white flesh.	\r\n23,806\r\nDiadromous fish (Atlantic salmon)	diadromous	Diadromous fish are fishes which migrate between the sea and fresh water. Some seafood groups are salmon, shad, eels and lampreys. See: Salmon run.	\r\n5,348\r\nFreshwater fish (tilapia)	freshwater	Freshwater fish live in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Some seafood groups are carp, tilapia, catfish, bass, and trout. Generally, freshwater fish lend themselves to fish farming more readily than the ocean fish, and the larger part of the tonnage reported here refers to farmed fish.	\r\n43,511\r\nmolluscs	Molluscs (from the Latin molluscus, meaning soft ) are invertebrates with soft bodies that are not segmented like crustaceans. Bivalves and gastropods are protected by a calcareous shell which grows as the mollusc grows. Cephalopods are not protected by a shell.Total for molluscs:  	\r\n20,797\r\nBivalve	bivalves	Bivalves, sometimes referred to as clams, have a protective shell in two hinged parts. A valve is the name used for the protective shell of a bivalve, so bivalve literally means two shells. Important seafood bivalves include oysters, scallops, mussels and cockles. Most of these are filter feeders which bury themselves in sediment on the seabed where they are safe from predation. Others lie on the sea floor or attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces. Some, such as scallops, can swim. Bivalves have long been a part of the diet of coastal communities. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food.	12,585\r\nEmpty shell of an abalone	gastropods	Aquatic gastropods, also known as sea snails, are univalves which means they have a protective shell that is in a single piece. Gastropod literally means stomach-foot, because they appear to crawl on their stomachs. Common seafood groups are abalone, conch, limpets, whelks and periwinkles.	526\r\nOctopus	cephalopods	Cephalopods are not protected with a shell. Cephalopod literally means head-foots, because they have limbs which appear to issue from their head. They have excellent vision and high intelligence. Cephalopods propel themselves with a water jet and lay down \"smoke screens\" with ink. Examples are octopus, squid and cuttlefish. They are eaten in many cultures. Depending on the species, the arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways. Octopus must be boiled properly to rid it of slime, smell, and residual ink. Squid are popular in Japan. In Mediterranean countries and in Britain squid are often referred to as calamari.[16] Cuttlefish is less eaten than squid, though it is popular in Italy and dried, shredded cuttlefish is a snack food in East Asia. See: Squid (food) Octopus (food).	3,653\r\nother	Molluscs not included above	4,033\r\ncrustaceans	Crustaceans (from Latin crusta, meaning crust ) are invertebrates with segmented bodies protected by hard crusts (shells or exoskeletons), usually made of chitin and structured somewhat like a knight\'s armour. The shells do not grow, and must periodically be shed or moulted. Usually two legs or limbs issue from each segment. Most commercial crustaceans are decapods, that is they have ten legs, and have compound eyes set on stalks. Their shell turns pink or red when cooked.Total for crustaceans:  	11,827\r\nNorthern prawn	shrimps	Shrimp and prawns, are small, slender, stalk-eyed ten-legged crustaceans with long spiny rostrums. They are widespread, and can be found near the seafloor of most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers and lakes. They play important roles in the food chain. There are numerous species, and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat. Any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one.[17] See: shrimp (food), shrimp fishery, shrimp farming, freshwater prawn farming.	6,917\r\nMud crab	crabs	Crabs are stalk-eyed ten-legged crustaceans, usually walk sideways, and have grasping claws as their front pair of limbs. They have small abdomens, short antennae, and a short carapace that is wide and flat. See: crab fisheries.	1,679[18]\r\nClawed lobster	lobsters	Clawed lobsters and spiny lobsters are stalk-eyed ten-legged crustaceans with long abdomens. The clawed lobster has large asymmetrical claws for its front pair of limbs, one for crushing and one for cutting (pictured). The spiny lobster lacks the large claws, but has a long, spiny antennae and a spiny carapace. Lobsters are larger than most shrimp or crabs. See: lobster fishing.	281[19]\r\nNorthern krill	krill	Krill are like baby shrimps, except they have external gills and more than ten legs (swimming plus feeding and grooming legs). They are found in oceans around the world where they filter feed in huge pelagic swarms.[20] Like shrimp, they are an important part of the marine food chain, converting phytoplankton into a form larger animals can consume. Each year, larger animals eat half the estimated biomass of krill (about 600 million tonnes).[20] Humans consume krill in Japan and Russia, but most of the krill harvest is used to make fish feed and for extracting oil. Krill oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, similarly to fish oil. See: Krill fishery.	215\r\nother	Crustaceans not included above	1,359\r\nother aquatic animals	Total for other aquatic animals:  	1409+\r\nDolphin\r\n\r\nFluke of a whale\r\n\r\naquatic mammals	Marine mammals form a diverse group of 128 species that rely on the ocean for their existence.[21] Whale meat is still harvested from legal, non-commercial hunts.[22] About one thousand long-finned pilot whales are still killed annually.[23] Japan has resumed hunting for whales, which they call \"research whaling\".[24] In modern Japan, two cuts of whale meat are usually distinguished: the belly meat and the more valued tail or fluke meat. Fluke meat can sell for $200 per kilogram, three times the price of belly meat.[25] Fin whales are particularly desired because they are thought to yield the best quality fluke meat.[26] In Taiji in Japan and parts of Scandinavia such as the Faroe Islands, dolphins are traditionally considered food, and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts.[27] Ringed seals are still an important food source for the people of Nunavut[28] and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska.[29] The meat of sea mammals can be high in mercury, and may pose health dangers to humans when consumed.[30] The FAO record only the reported numbers of aquatic mammals harvested, and not the tonnage. In 2010, they reported 2500 whales, 12,000 dolphins and 182,000 seals. See: marine mammals as food, whale meat, seal hunting.	?\r\nSea cucumber	aquatic reptiles	Sea turtles have long been valued as food in many parts of the world. Fifth century BC Chinese texts describe sea turtles as exotic delicacies.[31] Sea turtles are caught worldwide, although in many countries it is illegal to hunt most species.[32] Many coastal communities around the world depend on sea turtles as a source of protein, often gathering sea turtle eggs, and keeping captured sea turtles alive on their backs until needed for consumption.[33] Most species of sea turtle are now endangered, and some are critically endangered.[34] The FAO reports 1,418,975 crocodiles were harvested in 2010, but they do not record the tonnage.	296+\r\nSea cucumber	echinoderms	Echinoderms are headless invertebrates, found on the seafloor in all oceans and at all depths. They are not found in fresh water. They usually have a five-pointed radial symmetry, and move, breathe and perceive with their retractable tube feet. They are covered with a calcareous and spiky test or skin. The name echinoderm comes from the Greek ekhinos meaning hedgehog, and dermatos meaning skin. Echinoderms used for seafood include sea cucumbers, sea urchins, and occasionally starfish. Wild sea cucumbers are caught by divers and in China they are farmed commercially in artificial ponds.[35] The gonads of both male and female sea urchins, usually called sea urchin roe or corals,[36] are delicacies in many parts of the world.[37][38] See: sea cucumber (food).	373\r\nRehydrated jellyfish strips	jellyfish	Jellyfish are soft and gelatinous, with a body shaped like an umbrella or bell which pulsates for locomotion. They have long, trailing tentacles with stings for capturing prey. They are found free-swimming in the water column in all oceans, and are occasionally found in freshwater. Jellyfish must be dried within hours to prevent spoiling. In Japan they are regarded as a delicacy. Traditional processing methods are carried out by a jellyfish master. This involve a 20 to 40-day multi-phase procedure which starts with removing the gonads and mucous membranes. The umbrella and oral arms are then treated with a mixture of table salt and alum, and compressed. Processing reduces liquefaction, odor, the growth of spoilage organisms, and makes the jellyfish drier and more acidic, producing a crisp and crunchy texture. Only scyphozoan jellyfish belonging to the order Rhizostomeae are harvested for food; about 12 of the approximately 85 species. Most of the harvest takes place in southeast Asia.[39][40][41]	\r\n404\r\nSea squirt	other	Aquatic animals not included above, such as ducks, sea squirts (pictured), spoon worms, lancelets and frogs.	336\r\naquatic plants and microphytes	Total for aquatic plants and microphytes:  	19,893\r\nSeaweed/sea urchin soup\r\nSea grapes\r\n\r\n	Seaweed is a loose colloquial term which lacks a formal definition. Broadly, the term is applied to the larger, macroscopic forms of algae, as opposed to microalga. Examples of seaweed groups are the multicellular red, brown and green algae.[42] Edible seaweeds usually contain high amounts of fibre and, in contrast to terrestrial plants, contain a complete protein.[43] Seaweeds are used extensively as food in coastal cuisines around the world. Seaweed has been a part of diets in China, Japan, and Korea since prehistoric times.[44] Seaweed is also consumed in many traditional European societies, in Iceland and western Norway, the Atlantic coast of France, northern and western Ireland, Wales and some coastal parts of South West England,[45] as well as Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. See: edible seaweed, seaweed farming, aquaculture of giant kelp, laverbread.	\r\nSpirulina tablets	microphytes	Microphytes are microscopic organisms, and can be algal, bacterial or fungal. Microalgae are another type of aquatic plant, and includes species that can be consumed by humans and animals. \r\nSome species of aquatic bacteria can also be used as seafood, such as spirulina (pictured), a type of cyanobacteria.

In India, application of mechanical power, introduction of semi-automatic and automatic machines, improvements in the production processes, better Morale and Productivity integration of production processes and higher degree of specialisation have contributed a lot towards the increases in industrial productivity.\r\n\r\n(ii) Quality of Human Resources:\r\n\r\nManpower plays a significant role. In raising industrial productivity in most of the industries. If the labour force is not adequately qualified and/or is not properly motivated, all the steps taken to increase the industrial productivity will have no result the employeesâ€™ performance and attitudes have an immense effect on the productivity of any industrial unit. Three important factors which influence the productivity of labour area (a) ability of the worker, (b) willingness of the worker, and (c) the environment under which he has to work.\r\n\r\n(iii) Availability of Finance:\r\n\r\nThe ambitious plans of an industrial unit to increase the productivity will remain mere dreams if adequate financial resources are not available to introduce technical improvements and give appropriate training to the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater the degree of mechanistion to be introduced, the greater is the need for capital. Capital will also be required for investment in research and development activities, advertisement campaign, better working conditions to the workers, up-keep of plant and machinery, etc.\r\n\r\n(iv) Managerial Talent:\r\n\r\nThe significance of managerial talent has increased with the advancement in technology. Professional managers are required to make better use of the new technological development. Since the modern enterprises are run on a large scale, the managers must possess imagination, judgment and willingness to take imitative.\r\n\r\nThe managers should be devoted towards their profession and they should understand their social responsibilities towards the owners of the business, workers, customers, suppliers. Government, and the society this is essential if the managers want to manage their organisations effectively. The managers should have conceptual, human relations and technical skills in order to increases the productivity of the enterprise.\r\n\r\n(v) Government Policy:\r\n\r\nThe industrial policies of the Government have an important impact on the industrial productivity; The Government should frame and implement such policies which create favourable conditions for saving, investment, flow of capital from one industrial sector to another and conservation of national resources. Certain industries may be granted protection, and incentives may be given to the others for the development in view of the national interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government should flow the taxation policy which does not discourage the further expansion of business. It is also the duty of the Government to check the growth of monopolistic enterprises so that the interest, of the consumers and the workers are not jeopardise.\r\n\r\n(vi) Natural Factors:\r\n\r\nThe natural factors such as physical, geographical and climatic exercise considerable impact on the industrial productivity. The relative importance of these factors depends upon the nature of the industry, goods and services produced and the extent to which physical conditions are controlled.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe geological and physical factors play a very dominant role in determining the productivity of extractive industries likes coal-mining in which the physical output per head is greatly influenced by the depth of the coal-mines, the thickness of the coal seams, the topography of the region and the quality of coal available.

Which will result in evolution of green house gases like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n1. The combustion of natural gas/fuel oil and the decomposition of raw materials during the melting lead to the emission of CO2. This is the only greenhouse gas emitted during the production of glass. And finally leads to the cause of green house effect.\r\n\r\n2. Nitrogen oxides (NO2) due to the high melting temperatures and in some cases due to decomposition of nitrogen compounds contribute to acidification.\r\n\r\n3. Glasses is non-biodegradable because it is photolysis resistant. Glasses donot degrade naturally in the environment. Hence, glasses is burnt to reduce the waste but incinerating glasse is more harmful.\r\n\r\n4. Evaporation from the molten glass and raw materials can cause release of particles in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n5. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) from the fuel and/or from decomposition of sulphate in the batch materials can contribute to acidification and formation of SMOG.\r\n\r\n6. Glass is a non-degradable, if pieces of broken glass material flow into water body, it may affect the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n7. Sometimes, drainage system may be blocked due to aggregation of broken parts of glasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Thermocol - \r\nA. It is a carcinogen: Some research on cancer has showed that styrene may contain carcinogens and increase the risks of cancer in humans  and can cause lymphoma and leukemia cancer upon prolonged exposure.\r\n\r\nB. It is non-biodegradable: Thermocol is non-biodegradable because it is photolysis resistant. Thermocol needs a very long time to degrade naturally in the environment. Hence, thermocol is burnt to reduce the waste but incinerating thermocol is more harmful.\r\n\r\nC. It contaminates the food and drinks: Even though food and drinks are served on thermocol plates and cups, these actually contaminate the food and beverages and affect the health and the reproductive systems of humans. When food are reheated while they are still in thermocol container the harmful effect on humansâ€™ health are seen.\r\n\r\nD. It affects the health of workers who work in thermocol manufacturing plants: Thermocol, more particularly styrene, adversely affects the health of the workers in the thermocol manufacturing units. The workers working for a prolonged period complain of eyes, skin, and respiratory tract irritation as well as gastrointestinal complications.\r\nThermocol plant workers also complain of problems in liver, kidneys, respiratory, and nervous systems. It has been found responsible for natural abortions in pregnant women. Exposure to liquid styrene can result in burns.\r\n\r\n6.

We must reduce our plastic dependency:\r\nWe use an incredible quantity of single-use plastic items, such as straws, plastic bags, packaging, plastic cups, plates and cutlery. We must put an end to it. An increasing number of countries have now imposed a ban on disposable plastics and plastic bags, or established concrete targets for reducing plastic consumption and waste.\r\n\r\n2. Increase fees and taxes on polluting plastics:\r\nMost of the plastics used today are produced from oil, and are a source of both climate emissions and pollution. Governments need to investigate and implement a tax or fee on polluting plastics. The fees must be changed so that recycled plastic becomes cheaper than fossil.\r\n\r\n3. Increased waste management where the problem is greatest:\r\nThe bulk of plastic waste comes from developing countries. Rapid population growth and a swelling middle class means the consumption of plastic is increasing faster than the capacity to handle the plastic waste, and therefore much of the excess ends up in the sea. lished to develop waste management and recycling infrastructure.\r\n\r\n4. Increased mapping, surveillance and research:\r\nThere is still much we do not know about the plastic problem. Researchers estimate that more than 70 percent of the plastic ends up on the sea floor. Over time, it breaks down into tiny particles, but we do not know what happens to this material or how to get rid of it. The efforts to map and monitor, as well as conduct research on the negative effects, must be strengthened.\r\n\r\n5. Stop the flow of plastic waste into the sea:\r\nthe plastic in the ocean is suspected to come from activities and industry on land. This can include everything from car tyres, technical sports equipment and fleece clothing, to cigarette butts and cotton buds. Everyone should contribute to the solution. For example, you can participate in clean-up operations, cut your own plastic consumption and of course always pick up any garbage you find along your way.\r\n\r\n6. Increased funds for clean-up:\r\nTo solve the plastic problem, we must ensure that action and clean-up operations are undertaken in areas where the problem is the greatest. Much of the work, however, is hampered due to the lack of financial resources. By establishing a global ocean fund, with waste management and clean-up of marine areas high on the agenda, we will be one step closer towards the goal: a future without plastic and marine pollution in our ocean.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Latent heat of a body is the amount of heat required to change the state of unit mass of the body from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas without any change in temperature. If latent heat is given off, then the body in liquid state will transform to solid state and the body in vapour state will transform to liquid state. This means the internal energy of the matter decreases when latent heat is given off.\r\n\r\nb. Principle of heat exchange is used in the calorimetry method to determine the specific heat capacity of a substance.\r\n\r\nc. According to the kinetic model, the total energy of a molecule is the sum of kinetic energy due to its motion (which depends on temperature) and its potential energy (which depends on the force of attraction between the molecules and the separation between them. During the phase change of a substance, its temperature does not increase and hence its kinetic energy. But the potential energy increases or decreases depending on the type of phase transformation (for ex: while melting of ice, the separation between the molecules of ice increases and hence its potential energy). Thus, some energy is required in increases or decreasing the separation between the molecules. Thus, the heat supplied during phase transformation is used up in increasing or decreasing the potential energy and this heat energy is known as latent heat.\r\n\r\nd.

Peat is an important industrial fuel in some regions, including Ireland and Finland. When dehydrated, peat becomes an effective absorbent for fuel and oil spills on both land and water.\r\n\r\nLignite\r\n\r\nLignite is formed from compressed peat, and is often referred to as brown coal. Lignite is a low ranking and highly volatile coal which is used mainly in power stations. It is sometimes found in European briquettes.\r\n\r\nBituminous/Sub Bituminous Coal\r\n\r\nFormed from compressed lignite, bituminous coals are a dense, sedimentary rock which is usually black in colour, but can sometimes be a 8dark brown. These coals are widely used in the manufacturing of briquettes, and are also used in power stations, for heat and power applications in manufacturing, and to make coke.\r\n\r\nSteam Coal\r\n\r\nSteam coal is the stepping stone between bituminous coal and anthracite. It was once used to fuel steam trains, and as the use of them declined, so did the use of steam coal.\r\n\r\nAnthracite\r\n\r\nAnthracite is the highest rank of ignitable coal. It is hard, black and glossy, and as a natural smokeless fuel, is used primarily for residential and commercial space heating. Anthracite is the main source of many manufactured fuels, and provides a good heat output, and long burning times.\r\n\r\nGraphite\r\n\r\nThe technically highest ranking coal, graphite is difficult to ignite, and is rarely used as a fuel. It is mostly used in pencils, and as a lubricant in its powdered form.\r\n\r\nSteam coal - also known as thermal coal - is mainly used in power generation.\r\nCoking coal - also known as metallurgical coal - is mainly used in steel production.\r\n\r\nActivated carbon - used in filters for water and air purification and in kidney dialysis machines.\r\nCarbon fibre - an extremely strong but light weight reinforcement material used in construction, mountain bikes and tennis rackets.\r\nSilicon metal - used to produce silicones and silanes, which are in turn used to make lubricants, water repellents, resins, cosmetics, hair shampoos and toothpast.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The coordination which occurs with the help of hormones is called chemical coordination. Hormones are the organic chemicals produced by the body, which are released into the blood. The key feature of the hormones is that they are secreted by the ductless glands. The glands that secrete hormones do not have ducts. Hormones are released directly into the bloodstream and reach the target organ. The endocrine system works in association with nervous system to control and coordinate our bodies. \r\nCharacteristics of Hormones\r\nHormones are the organic chemicals that are secreted in response to environmental changes in or outside the body.\r\nHormones are secreted by ductless glands and transported along with the blood stream to the site of their action. The site of their production and the organ of their influence are different.\r\nThey can be amino-acid derivatives, proteins, or steroids.\r\nBeing low molecular weight substances, they can easily diffuse through the cell membrane.\r\nThey are produced in small quantities and are effective in extremely lower concentrations.\r\nAbnormal production of hormones (be it less or more) affects the body in a negative manner.\r\ni. Some of the hormones produced by pituitary are:\r\nProlactin- Growth of mammary glands and formation of milk in them.\r\nTSH- Synthesis and release of thyroid hormones.\r\nAdrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)- Stimulates synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex.\r\nVasopressin- Stimulates reabsorption of water from the distal tubules, and hence, prevents loss of water through urine (diuresis); therefore, also called anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).\r\n ii.

These qualities may be either expressed or they may be latent in the offspring.\r\nThe mechanism of heredity involves:\r\nMating: Fusion of the male germ cell spermatozoa with the female ovum (transfer of gametes and their fusion)\r\nGrowth: Repeated mitotic division of the zygote (fertilized egg).\r\nChromosomes: Both the male and female gametes contain a nucleus which further contains the chromosomes. Both of them have 24 chromosomes each. (Therefore, called haploid cells)\r\nGene: Chromosomes further contain smaller structures that are called genes. Now these genes are the structures that get passed on. Different genes are responsible for different characters. For example, there are genes that determine eye colour, genes that determine your blood group etc. Genes get passed onto the progeny from both the mother and father. Depending on the dominance of the gene, that particular character would be expressed in the progeny.\r\nChance factor: Even though each parent passes on 24 pairs of chromosomes to the progeny, the progeny doesn\'t have 48 pairs of chromosomes on fertilization.

After that unicellular organisms were formed. With the gradual changes in the unicellular organisms, multicellular and complex organisms were formed. These changes were slow and gradual which took 300yrs and more. The progressive development of plants and animals from the ancestors having different structural and functional organization is called evolution. There are many proofs supporting the theories.\r\nI. Morphological evidence: Similarities in morphology and physical structure prove that they have the same origin and common ancestors. For example structure of the mouth, the position of nostrils, ear pinnae, and thick hair on full-body in animals like dog, goat, and sheep.\r\nII. Anatomical evidence: Organs of different animals are dissimilar in function but similar in structures of bones and bony joints show that these animals may have common ancestors. For example, the human hand, catâ€™s foreleg, patagium of bat, and flipper of whale perform a different function but their bones are similar in structure.\r\nIII. Vestigial organs as evidence: Underdeveloped useless organs in organisms are called vestigial organs. Such organs are useless in some organisms but these organs are useful in other organisms. For example appendix useless in humans but functional in cattle. Ear pinna muscle useless in humans but useful in monkeys.\r\nIV. Paleontological evidence: many organisms get buried under the ground due to disasters like floods, volcano, earthquakes. Remnants and impressions of these organisms are preserved underground and are called fossils. The study of fossils is very important for the study of evolution.\r\nV. Connecting links: Some plants and animals have some morphological characters by which they can be related to different groups are called connecting links. Example Lungfish resembles the fish in having paired fins, gills, and scales on its body, but it respires through lungs like amphibians. Thus, lungfish acts as a connecting link between fish and amphibians.\r\n\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The intermolecular force of attraction is high in ionic compounds and, large energy is required to overcome it. Therefore, the melting and boiling points of ionic compounds are high.\r\n\r\n4. Ionic compounds are water soluble. This is because the water molecules orient in a particular manner around the ions separated by dissociation process. As a result of this a new force of attraction is established between the ion and the surrounding water molecules, replacing the original intermolecular attraction; and aqueous solutions of ionic compounds are formed. Ionic compounds are however, insoluble in solvents like kerosene and petrol. This is because unlike water a new attractive force can not be established in these solvents.\r\n\r\n5. The ionic compounds cannot conduct electricity when in solid state. In this state the ions cannot leave their places. However, in the fused/molten state they can conduct electricity, as in this state the ions are mobile.

It stimulates development.\r\nIt does this through:\r\n1.Creating employment - direct and indirect\r\n2.Increasing foreign currency earnings\r\n3.Increasing visitor numbers and visitor spending withing the local economy\r\n4.Increasing income for commercial operators\r\n5.Economic development and regeneration.\r\n\r\nb)Environmental Objectives\r\n\r\nThe saying \'tourism destroys tourism\' is well known: protection of the environment is essential in areas that are subject to damage by tourist numbers. Thus the main environmental objective of tourism are as follows:\r\n1. Habitat preservation\r\n2. Regeneration and conservation of the build and natural environment\r\n3. Environmental education\r\n4. Environmental improvements.\r\n\r\nc)Socio-cultural Objectives\r\n\r\nTourism brings people of different countries together and we all need to increase our awareness and understanding of different cultures. Tourism can generate income and provide funds to keep traditional cultures alive and to improve the quality of life for the host population. The main socio-cultural objectives of tourism development are:\r\n1. To promote understanding of different cultures\r\n2. To improve quality of life for the local population\r\n3. To provide community facilities, as well as tourist facilities\r\n4. To develop a sense of pride in traditional culture and identity.\r\n\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Electric motor ', 'Motor principle: The basic principle on which the electric motor works is the magnetic effect of current. A current carrying rectangular coil starts rotating when placed in a magnetic field.\r\nThe given figure illustrates the internal parts of a simple electric motor. A motor consists of a rectangular coil MNST of insulated copper wire. The coil is placed between two magnetic poles such that the magnetic field acts normal on lengths MN and ST. The coil is connected with two carbon brushes at points A and B respectively. The inner sides of these carbon brushes are in contact with half rings C and D, which are insulated and in contact with an axle (not shown in the figure).\r\n\r\nWorking: When a current is allowed to flow through the coil MNST by closing the switch, the coil starts rotating anti-clockwise. This happens because a downward force acts on length MN and at the same time, an upward force acts on length ST. As a result, the coil rotates anti-clockwise.\r\nThe current in length MN flows from M to N, and magnetic field acts from left to right normal to length MN. Hence, according to Flemingâ€™s left hand rule, a downward force acts on length MN. Similarly, the current in length ST flows from S to T, and magnetic field acts from left to right normal to its length. Hence, an upward force acts on length ST. These two forces cause the coil MNST and the axle to rotate anti-clockwise.\r\nAfter half-rotation, the position of length MN and ST get interchanged. Simultaneously, half ring D comes in contact with brush A and half ring C comes in contact with brush B respectively. Hence, the direction of current in coil MNST gets reversed and flows through TSNM.\r\nAn electric device that reverses the direction of current in a circuit is called a commutator. Thus, the split ring acts as a commutator of the electric motor. Now, due to the reverse direction of current in lengths MN and ST, an upward force acts on length MN, which pushes it up and a downward force acts on length ST, which pushes it down. As a result, the coil MNST further rotates anti-clockwise. The reversal of the current through the coil MNST repeats at each half-rotation, while its anti-clockwise rotation continues.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Thus, it converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.\r\n\r\nConstruction: A generator consists of a rectangular coil MNST of insulated copper wire placed between two strong magnetic poles. The two ends of the coil MNST are connected with brushes A and B of rings C and D respectively. The inner sides of the rings are insulated. They are attached with an axle X, which can be rotated mechanically. Brushes A and B are connected with a galvanometer that can measure the flow of current in coil MNST.\r\nWorking: When the axle is rotated, lengths MN and ST move up and down respectively. Since lengths MN and ST are moving in a magnetic field, a current gets induced in these lengths caused by an electromagnetic induction. The direction of the induced current in both the lengths is given by Flemingâ€™s right hand rule.\r\nSince length MN is moving upwards in the magnetic field that acts from left to right, the direction of the induced current will be from M to N. Similarly, the direction of the induced current in length ST will be from S to T. Hence, an induced current will set up in the coil in the direction MNST, which produces deflection in the galvanometer.\r\nAfter half-rotation, length MN starts moving down, whereas length ST starts moving up. The direction of the induced current in the coil gets reversed i.e., the induced current will now flow from T to M via S and N i.e., TSNM.

Conservation of water is essential for securing food grain production and sustaining various life-forms. In order to conserve water we ca run programmes on various levels to bring awareness abouit water coservation and its methods. The most talked about method is rain water harvesting.

Forest are a huge resource of wood and other products which is why they are exploited at a greater scale. In oreder to protect forests, the government and the public needs to work in harmony.

The potential energy of the balls converts to kinetic energy as they roll down.\r\n\r\n3. Note: The question is wrong. It should be \"Why do the balls cover same distance after rolling down\"?\r\n\r\nThe balls will posses same potential energy because the channels are of same height as well as the weight of the balls are same. So, the balls on reaching the bottom of their respective channels will posses same kinetic energy (following the law of conservation of energy). Thus, the balls will have same velocity at the bottom of the channel. Because of the same velocity, they will cover equal distance on the ground. Thus, both the balls covers equal distance after rolling down the incline because they possessed same potential energy at the top of the channels.\r\n\r\n4. The total energy of the ball will eventually be in the form of kinetic energy.\r\n\r\n5. Law of conservation of energy is demonstrated using this activity. At the top of the channels, the total mechanical energy of the balls is in the form of potential energy. Now, as the balls roll down, they come into motion. This motion shows that the balls now posses kinetic energy too. As law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, this means this kinetic energy came into existence because of decrease in potential energy of the ball (decrease in potential energy is due to decrease in height). Also, when the ball reaches the bottom, the total mechanical energy of the balls is in the form of kinetic energy. This shows that all the potential energy of the balls got converted to kinetic energy at the bottom. ', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Explain with examples types of asexual reproduction in unicellular organism.', 'a. Asexual reproduction in unicellular organisms can be of three types:\r\n\r\nBinary fission: Binary fission is the splitting of parent organisms into two halves, each of which develops to form a complete daughter cell. For example, Amoeba reproduces asexually by the process of binary fission. In Amoeba,binary fission begins with the division of the nucleus. This is followed by the division of the cytoplasm and the cell. Each part receives a portion of the nucleus. Finally, two cells are formed from one parent Amoeba.\r\n \r\n\r\nMultiple fission âˆ’ Multiple fission is also seen in Amoeba. In this method, the parent microbe divides into many daughter microbes. Amoeba shows multiple fission under adverse conditions. It covers itself in a protective covering and forms a structure known as cyst. Inside the cyst, the nuclei undergo repetitive nuclear division followed by cytoplasmic division and result in the formation of amoebules. These amoebules are released together when the conditions turn favourable.\r\n\r\nBudding âˆ’ In this method, a bud develops as an outgrowth from parent body. This developing bud detaches from the parent body and the daughter individual develops further. For example, yeast reproduces asexually through the method of budding. During this process, small bulb-like projections (called buds) start coming out of the yeast cell. These buds gradually grow in size and get detached from the parent cell to form a new yeast cell. The new yeast cell then grows and becomes mature to form more yeast cells.\r\n \r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

IVF is one such form of ART which includes different methods that can be a boon for childless couples:\r\nSurrogacy- This is a technique which is used for women who face problem in implantation of embryo in uterus. In this technique the donor of the oocyte is the women itself who has problem in implanting the embryo in the uterus. The collected oocyte is fertilized with the sperm of her husband in a test tube.

The various methods of vegetative propogation are:\r\n\r\nFrom underground stem: A potato plant has an underground stem known as the tuber. It has many buds called eyes. A vegetative bud consists of a short stem, around which immature overlapping leaves are present in a folded state. A bud can give rise to a new plant through asexual reproduction.\r\n\r\nRhizome: The underground stem of ginger is known as the rhizome which is capable of giving rise to a new plant. Corm is the underground stem as found in Gladiolus. It can also be used for vegetative propagation.\r\n\r\nThrough leaves: Leaves perform the function of photosynthesis. However, they can take part in asexual reproduction as well. In some plants, leaves can give rise to a new plant asexually. For example, the leaves of the plant Bryophyllum contain buds on its margins. These buds give rise to a new plant through asexual reproduction.\r\n\r\nFrom aerial stem: In certain plants, a slender stem arises from the base of the plant and touches the soil, it develops roots and buds at the point of contact with the soil and gives rise to new plants. When the new plant is old enough the stem connecting it to the parent plant withers away.\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The embryo which is obtained after fertilization is implanted in the uterus of another female who is called the surrogate mother.\r\nâ€¢	Sperm bank - It is a new concept which is similar to blood banks. Sperms are collected from the male donors after a thorough medical checkup and stored for future use.

(2) What changes have taken place in the nature of political parties in India?', 'Answer 1: The major characteristics of political parties are as follows:\r\n\r\nTo be in power: Achieving power through elections is the main objective of political parties. Thus different political parties compete with each other to get power. There is nothing wrong in this competition, but the competition should be fair.\r\nTo pursue an ideology: Every political party has some policies and world views. Parties have a particular stand about social issues. These together make party ideology. The people who consider any specific party ideology as acceptable support that political party. Social support received by a political party is called the â€˜mass baseâ€™ of political party. In modern days ideologies of all political parties appear to be similar hence it has become difficult to differentiate between the parties on the basis of ideologies.\r\nTo have a Party Agenda: Political parties prepare their partyâ€™s agenda on the basis of party ideology. They implement the agenda after they get political power. Even if they do not get political power, political parties try to get support of people on the basis of this agenda.\r\nTo Establish a Government: Political parties establish the government and govern the nation. The political party which gets the majority in elections forms the government. The parties which do not get majority act as opposition parties.\r\nTo act as a link between the Government and the people: Political parties work as a link between the Government and the people. Political parties communicate the demands and complaints of the people to the government. The government tries to get support of the people for its policies and programmes through political parties.\r\nAnswer 2: The changes that have taken place in the nature of political parties in India are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Congress was a strong political party in the post-independence period. Congress had a majority at the Centre and in most of the States. Indian politics was controlled by the Congress Party.

In the last few decades development is considered as the right of the citizens\r\n\r\n2  Citizen empowerment is the essential condition of democracy. It is necessary to create opportunities for citizenâ€™s participation and interaction with the government. Increased communication between citizens and government helps in strengthening democracy and in building a relationship of trust between them. Citizens have a right to know about the functioning of the government. The Government of India gave the Right to Information to the citizens of India toensure transparency and accountability which are the hallmarks of good governance. Right to Information has made the government more transparent and has reduced the element of secrecy in the working of government. After the year 2000, the whole approach towards democratic reforms has changed. Democratic reforms are considered as â€˜rightsâ€™ of citizens. Accordingly, citizens in India have got Right to Information, education and food security. These rights have strengthened democracy in India.\r\n\r\n3   In the post-independence period, efforts were made for empowering women. Taking into consideration the problems of women, several policies have been adopted at national and international level to remove illiteracy among women and to make available opportunities for their development.The right to have an equal share in the property of the father and husband, Dowry Prohibition Act, act against sexual harassment, Domestic Violence Prohibition Act are some important provisions which create a favourable environment for protection of freedom of women and securing their development\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire.  It was she who cooked the meals. It was she who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.\r\nâ€œWhat a mess!â€ her two stepsisters laughed.  And that is why they called her â€œCinderella.â€\r\n\r\nOne day, big news came to town.  The King and Queen were going to have a ball!  It was time for the Prince to find a bride. All of the young ladies in the land were invited to come.  They were wild with joy! They would wear their most beautiful gown and fix their hair extra nice. Maybe the prince would like them!\r\n\r\nAt Cinderellaâ€™s house, she now had extra work to do.  She had to make two brand-new gowns for her step-sisters.  \r\n\r\nâ€œFaster!â€ shouted one step-sister.\r\n\r\nâ€œYou call that a dress?â€ screamed the other.  \r\n\r\nâ€œOh, dear!â€ said Cinderella.  â€œWhen can Iâ€“â€œ\r\n\r\nThe stepmother marched into the room.  â€œWhen can you WHAT?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWell,â€ said the girl, â€œwhen will I have time to make my own dress for the ball?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYou?â€ yelled the stepmother.  â€œWho said YOU were going to the ball?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat a laugh!â€ said one step-sister.\r\n\r\nâ€œSuch a mess!â€ They pointed at Cinderella.  All of them laughed.\r\n\r\nCinderella said to herself, â€œWhen they look at me, maybe they see a mess.  But I am not that way.  And if I could, I WOULD go to the ball.â€\r\n\r\nSoon the time came for the stepmother and step-sisters to leave for the big party.\r\nTheir fine carriage came to the door. The stepmother and step-sisters hopped inside.  And they were off.\r\n\r\nâ€œGood-bye!â€ called Cinderella.  â€œHave a good time!â€ But her stepmother and step-sisters did not turn around to see her.\r\n\r\nâ€œAh, me!â€ said Cinderella sadly.  The carriage rode down the street.  She said aloud, â€œI wish I could go to the ball, too!â€\r\n\r\nThen - Poof!\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, in front of her was a fairy.\r\n\r\nâ€œYou called?â€ said the fairy.\r\n\r\nâ€œDid I?â€ said Cinderella.  â€œWho are you?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWhy, your Fairy Godmother, of course!  I know your wish.  And I have come to grant it.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œButâ€¦â€ said Cinderella, â€œmy wish is impossible.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExcuse me!â€ said the Fairy Godmother in a huff.  â€œDid I not just show up out of thin air?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYes, you did,â€ said Cinderella.\r\n\r\nâ€œThen let me be the one to say what is possible or not!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWell, I think you know I want to go to the ball, too.â€ She looked down at her dirty clothes.\r\n\r\n â€œBut look at me.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œYou do look a bit of a mess, child,â€ said the Fairy Godmother.\r\n\r\nâ€œEven if I had something nice to wear,\" said the girl, \"I would have no way to get there.\"\r\n\r\nâ€œDear me, all of that is possible,â€ said the Fairy. With that, she tapped her wand on Cinderellaâ€™s head.\r\nAt once, Cinderella was all clean.  She was dressed in a beautiful blue gown.  Her hair was set up high on her head inside a golden band.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis is wonderful!â€ said Cinderella.\r\n\r\nâ€œWho said I was done?â€ said the Fairy Godmother.  She tapped her wand again. At once, a beautiful carriage came to be, with a driver and four white horses.\r\nâ€œAm I dreaming?â€ said Cinderella, looking around her.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt is as real, as real can be,â€ said the Fairy Godmother.  â€œBut there is one thing you must know.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat is that?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œAll of this lasts only to midnight.  Tonight, at the stroke of midnight, it will all be over.  Everything will go back to how it was before.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThen I must be sure to leave the ball before midnight!â€ said Cinderella.\r\n\r\nâ€œGood idea,â€ said the Fairy Godmother.  She stepped back. â€œMy work is done.â€ And with that, the Fairy Godmother was gone.\r\n\r\nCinderella looked around her.  \"Did that even happen?\"  But there she stood in a fine gown, and with a golden band in her hair.  And there were her driver and four horses before her, waiting.\r\n\r\nâ€œComing?â€ called the driver.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe stepped into the carriage.  And they were off.\r\nOver at the ball, the Prince did not know what to think.  â€œWhy do you have that sad look on your face?â€ the Queen said to her son.  â€œLook around you! You could not ask for finer maidens than these.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œI know, Mother,â€ said the Prince.  Yet he knew something was wrong. He had met many of the young women.  Yet after he said â€œhello,â€ one by one, he could find nothing more to say.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\"  Someone pointed to the front door.  â€œWho is that?â€\r\n\r\nAll heads turned.  Who was that lovely maiden stepping down the stairs?  She held her head tall and looked as if she belonged. But no one knew her.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere is something about her,â€ said the Prince to himself.  â€œI will ask her to dance.â€ And he walked over to Cinderella.\r\n\r\nâ€œHave we met?â€ said the Prince.\r\n\r\nâ€œI am pleased to meet you now,â€ said Cinderella with a bow.\r\n\r\nâ€œI feel as if I know you,â€ said the Prince.  â€œBut of course, that is impossible.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œMany things are possible,â€ said Cinderella, â€œif you wish them to be true.â€\r\n\r\nThe Prince felt a leap in his heart.  He and Cinderella danced. When the song was over, they danced again.  And then they danced again, and yet again. Soon the other maidens at the ball grew jealous.  â€œWhy is he dancing all the time with her?â€ they said. â€œHow rude!â€\r\n\r\nBut all the Prince could see was Cinderella.  They laughed and talked, and they danced some more.  In fact, they danced for so long that Cinderella did not see the clock.\r\n\r\nâ€œDong!â€ said the clock.\r\n\r\nCinderella looked up. \r\nâ€œDong!â€ went the clock again.  \r\n\r\nShe looked up again.  â€œOh, my!â€ she cried out.  â€œIt is almost midnight!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œDong!â€ rung the clock.  \r\n\r\nâ€œWhy does that matter?â€ said the Prince.\r\n\r\nâ€œDong!â€ called the clock.\r\n\r\nâ€œI must go!â€ said Cinderella.  \r\n\r\nâ€œDong!â€ went the clock.\r\n\r\nâ€œBut we just met!â€ said the Prince.  â€œWhy leave now?â€\r\n\r\nâ€œDong!â€ rung the clock.\r\n\r\nâ€œI must GO!â€ said Cinderella.  She ran to the door.\r\nâ€œDong!â€ said the clock.\r\n\r\nâ€œI cannot hear you,â€ said the Prince.  â€œThe clock is too loud!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œDong!â€ rung the clock.\r\n\r\nâ€œGoodbye!â€ said Cinderella. Up, up the stairs she ran.\r\n\r\nâ€œDong!â€ went the clock.\r\n\r\nâ€œPlease, stop for a moment!â€ said the Prince.\r\n\r\nâ€œOh, dear!â€ she said as one glass slipper fell off her foot on the stair.  But Cinderella kept running \r\nâ€œDong!â€ said the clock.\r\n\r\nâ€œPlease wait a moment!â€ said the Prince.  \r\n\r\nâ€œDong!â€ rung the clock.\r\n\r\nâ€œGoodbye!â€ Cinderella turned one last time.  Then she rushed out the door.\r\n\r\nâ€œDong!â€  The clock was quiet. It was midnight.  \r\n\r\nâ€œWait!â€ called the Prince.  He picked up her glass slipper and rushed out the door.  He looked around but could not see her blue dress anywhere.  â€œThis is all I have left from her,â€ he said, looking down at the glass slipper.  He saw that it was made in a special way, to fit a foot like none other. â€œSomewhere there is the other glass slipper,â€ he said.  â€œAnd when I find it, I will find her, too.  Then I will ask her to be my bride!â€\r\n\r\nFrom hut to hut, from house to house, went the Prince.  One young woman after another tried to fit her foot inside the glass slipper.  But none could fit. And so the Prince moved on.\r\n\r\nAt last the Prince came to Cinderellaâ€™s house.  \r\n\r\nâ€œHe is coming!â€ called one step-sister as she looked out the window.\r\n\r\nâ€œAt the door!â€ screamed the other step-sister.  \r\n\r\nâ€œQuick!â€ yelled the stepmother.  â€œGet ready! One of you must be the one to fit your foot in that slipper.  No matter what!â€\r\n\r\nThe Prince knocked.  The stepmother flew open the door.  â€œCome in!â€ she said. â€œI have two lovely daughters for you to see.â€\r\n\r\nThe first step-sister tried to place her foot in the glass slipper.  She tried hard, but it just would not fit. Then the second step-sister tried to fit her foot inside.  She tried and tried with all her might, too. But no dice.\r\n\r\nâ€œAre there no other young women in the house?â€ said the Prince.\r\n\r\nâ€œNone,â€ said the stepmother.\r\n\r\nâ€œThen I must go,â€ said the Prince.\r\n\r\nâ€œMaybe there is one more,â€ said Cinderella, stepping into the room.\r\n\r\nâ€œI thought you said there were no other young women here,â€ said the Prince.\r\n\r\nâ€œNone who matter!â€ said the stepmother in a hiss.\r\n\r\nâ€œCome here,â€ said the Prince.\r\nCinderella stepped up to him.  The Prince got down on one knee and tried the glass slipper on her foot.  It fit perfectly! Then, from her pocket Cinderella took out something. It was the other glass slipper!\r\n\r\nâ€œI knew it!â€ he cried.  â€œYou are the one!â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWHAT?â€ shouted a step-sister.  \r\n\r\nâ€œNot HER!â€ screamed the other step-sister.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis cannot BE!â€ yelled the stepmother.  \r\n\r\nBut it was too late.  The prince knew that Cinderella was the one.  He looked into her eyes. He did not see the cinders in her hair or the ashes on her face.\r\n\r\nâ€œI have found you!â€ he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œAnd I have found you,â€ said Cinderella.\r\n\r\nAnd so Cinderella and the Prince were married, and they lived happily ever after.\r\n\r\nend\r\n\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

When it moves on the pebbles it creates soft pleasing sound.\r\n*The brook moves on taking many curves and creates rough and unpleasant sound on the banks of the \r\n brook. The brook moves through many field and uncultivated lands. The brook goes through the foreland \r\n i.e. the land just before the merging point.

The brook carries blossoms on its way. Along with the brook there go a lot of fishes like lusty trout and grayling.\r\n *After facing the obstacles the brook again takes a curve and starts flowing to join the brimming river.

He wore rather a baggy grey shepherdâ€™s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.â€ The man also had a â€œblazing redhead and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.â€\r\nAs for Vincent Spaulding, the assistant, Â Mr. Wilson describes him as a â€œgood manâ€ with â€œno viceâ€. He is Â â€œSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though heâ€™s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.â€ Â \r\nMr. Duncan Ross, the employer was described by Mr. Wilson as a â€œlittle manâ€ who was quite â€œfavorableâ€ to him. Mr. Ross had initiated him into the job and kept a check on him. Â \r\nMr. Merryweather from Scotland Yard, despite his name, has been described as â€œa long, thin, sad-faced manâ€. Â \r\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle has paid detailed attention to characterization, to the extent that no character is what he seems to be. There is much more to each character than meets the eye.\r\nFor instance, though Watson analyzed Mr. Wilsonâ€™s appearance, he could not get any clues out of it and concluded that Mr. Wilson was just a commoner, with nothing â€œremarkableâ€ about him. Yet Sherlock Holmesâ€™ analysis surprised both Mr.Wilson and Watson. Holmes was quick to conclude (with evidence) that Mr. Wilson has â€œat some time done manual labor, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing latelyâ€.\r\nSimilarly, the assistant turns out to be a wanted criminal, John Clay. Without even seeing or meeting him, Holmes knows that the man has pierced ears. The man had cunningly entrapped Mr. Wilson into the job at the Red Hair League. The man with â€œnoviceâ€ was aiming to rob a bank. The benevolent employer, Mr. Ross did not turn out to be a credible character either. Â \r\nAdditionally, Mr. Merryweather does not come across as a man of much importance. However, he is not only part of the Scotland Yard, but also heads the bank, which makes him important enough to be part of the mission. Â \r\nFurther, Jones, whom Holmes describes as â€œan absolute imbecile in his professionâ€, is supposed â€œas brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobsterâ€.\r\nHolmes himself has been described, by Watson, as a â€œdual personalityâ€. At a time when to the rest of the world he looked like he was â€œ wrapped in the most perfect happinessâ€, his mind was actually thinking things through. He was analyzing information, piecing clues together, and looking for possibilities.\r\n\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Inequalities between men and women in the society generate lots of problems which become a big obstruction in the way to success of nation. It is the birth rights of the women to get equal value to the men in the society. To really bring empowerment, every woman needs to be aware about their rights from their own end.

They are much better than men to deal with certain problems in the society. They can better understand the disadvantages of the overpopulation for their family and country.

Women are capable enough to handle any impulsive violence in comparison to the men whether in the family or society.\r\n\r\nThrough women empowerment, it can be possible to change the male dominated country into the equally dominated country of rich economy.

The family intends to find wood to build a house with, and possibly some rod to build a ladder with. Ernest finds some bamboo in the sand, and the family cut these to lengths of five feet and bring them back to the tree. Using geometric calculations, they determine that they should build their house thirty feet up in the tree. They build a ladder and fix it to the ground with stakes. Then they fashion a pulley so that materials can be brought up into the tree. Later, more wood is collected from the beach for building, and these planks are pulled up into the tree to be arranged as a \"smooth solid floor.\" The sailcloth is then brought up to be slung over the highest branches in the tree and nailed down to the platform of planks. This makes a sort of treehouse or \"nest\" high up in the tree, enclosed on three sides by the sailcloth and the tree trunk, with the front left open to allow access down the ladder and to allow the sea breeze to blow in.\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

If you have the will power to do something, then nothing can stop you from doing so. This proverb is equally applicable in almost all aspects of life. Similarly, it holds utmost importance in various ways.This proverb is quite important in helping people push their limits and achieve their goals easily.

If you just dream and dream about something and do nothing to achieve it, you will most likely fail and become incompetent.

Raman, in full Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, (born November 7, 1888, Trichinopoly, Indiaâ€”died November 21, 1970, Bangalore), Indian physicist whose work was influential in the growth of science in India. He was the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930 for the discovery that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the light that is deflected changes in wavelength. This phenomenon is now called Raman scattering and is the result of the Raman effect.After earning a masterâ€™s degree in physics at Presidency College, University of Madras, in 1907, Raman became an accountant in the finance department of the Indian government. He became professor of physics at the University of Calcutta in 1917. Studying the scattering of light in various substances, in 1928 he found that when a transparent substance is illuminated by a beam of light of one frequency, a small portion of the light emerges at right angles to the original direction, and some of this light is of different frequencies than that of the incident light. These so-called Raman frequencies are the energies associated with transitions between different rotational and vibrational states in the scattering material.\r\n\r\nRaman was knighted in 1929, and in 1933 he moved to the Indian Institute of Science, at Bangalore, as head of the department of physics. In 1947 he was named director of the Raman Research Institute there and in 1961 became a member of the Pontifical Academy of Science. He contributed to the building up of nearly every Indian research institution in his time, founded the Indian Journal of Physics and the Indian Academy of Sciences, and trained hundreds of students who found important posts in universities and government in India and Myanmar (Burma).

Given the poor economic condition of the author at that time, visiting a highly expensive restaurant like Foyot along with a lady for a luncheon was very ironical. The author narrates in a flashback how at that point of time he could not turn down her request only to meet with embarrassing situation at the restaurant.\r\nIn the name of a little luncheon, the lady started placing order after order for highly expensive items from the menu like salmon, caviare, champagne, asparagus etc. without bothering about the bill.\r\nUnable to reveal his actual position, the author kept giving excuses for not ordering items for himself. Ultimately, he had to give away whatever money he had with him in paying the bill. He was left without even a penny and the whole month was before him. The author was not a vindictive man so he did not say a word to her but chose to endure.

From the library or Internet, read the story â€˜How much land does a man need?â€™ by Leo Tolstoy and write a review of the same, covering the following points. l Background of the story l Characters l Plot/Theme l Climax l Message/Moral', 'â€œHow Much Land Does a Man Needâ€ is a folktale. The characters are Russian peasants, people who actually work and derive sustenance from the land. In this story though, their simple life is complicated by a character with other motives, the Devil.\r\n\r\nBorn into Russian nobility, Tolstoy became less and less satisfied with his wealth and talent and good fortune as he grew older.  He even wanted to renounce the royalties from his famous novels, feeling strongly that no man should have so much while others starved.\r\n\r\nThis renunciation of wealth is ironically the unwritten message of this folktale. The title question is a universal metaphor for greed. Pakhom, a peasant farmer, is relatively successful and content with his lifeâ€”except for this question.\r\nAnd every time contentment begins to settle his life, the devil, always lurking nearby in some disguise, finds a way to raise this question again, and Pakhomâ€™s answer, always, is â€œMORE!â€  With his contentment then gone, Pakhom sets out to findâ€”and acquireâ€”â€œMORE!â€ and â€œMORE!â€ until too much of a good thing brings him to a tragic end.\r\nIn Tolstoyâ€™s world, this is a salvo at the land-owning nobility of Russia, including himself. In modern America, this easily applies to corporations that profit billions, yet pay zero taxes. It applies to CEOâ€™s who retire with millions in stock and bonuses, regardless of the quality of their work. It applies to companies who take their jobs overseas, leaving American workers in poverty. It applies to banks that loan money for mortgages recklessly, then foreclose on a familyâ€™s American Dream when things get tight. The list could go on.\r\nIn Medieval Morality Plays, the good guys won. Jesus would suddenly emerge when things looked darkest and vanquish the devil and other evil-doers, much to the delight of the audience. In this morality tale, thereâ€™s no cheering at the end; only laughter, and a little sorrow, at what a fool Pakhom was.\r\nIn short, this is a revival of a morality tale, by a master writer, in a world that needs morality. As such, it is certainly worth reading.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

In fact, it was not a poem earlier, but a monologue from the maestroâ€™s As You Like It. This monologue is said by Melancholy Jaques in Act II Scene VII. As the speech begins, seven different stages of a manâ€™s life are all that can come into your mind. Each and every word is so beautifully written that you can actually imagine everything that is written, just like a movie running in front of your eyes.\r\n\r\nThe seven stages of a manâ€™s life also refer to The Seven Ages Of Man. These ages are: infant, school going boy, lover/husband, soldier/fighter, justice/ability to understand the right and wrong, Pantalone (greediness and high in status) and old-age.\r\nIn this poem, Shakespeare has compared life with a stage. He has used different words to beautify the poem in a wonderful way. He has taken this concept from medieval philosophy, which showed glimpses of several different groups as the seven deadly sins for theological reasons. Theology is the study of Godâ€™s nature as well as religious belief.\r\nThere are two major poetic devices used in this poem â€“ simile and metaphor.  Simile examples in the poem: â€˜creeping like a snailâ€™; â€˜soldierâ€¦ bearded like the pardâ€™; etc.Metaphor examples in the poem: The entire poem itself is more like symbolism; men and women are portrayed as players whereas life is portrayed as the stage.\r\nRepetition is another figure of speech used in this poem; words like sans, age, etc. are repeated.\r\nAll The Worldâ€™s A Stage takes you to two stages â€“ melancholy and epiphany. When you read about the second last and last stages of the manâ€™s life, you realize that life is nothing, but mere play. All you need to do is take birth and leave, after performing all your duties.\r\nPersonally, I feel that this poem also talks about the roles of other people in your life. Just like you are playing your part, so are they! They enter into your lives to teach you something new, and leave, gifting you a bunch of memories to dwell upon.\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Discuss in pairs and tell your answer to the class.', 'Definition of science and technology\r\nScience from the Latin scientia (knowledge) is a system of acquiring knowledge based on the scientific method, as well as the organized body of knowledge gained through such research. Science as defined here is sometimes termed pure science to differentiate it from applied science, which is the application of scientific research to specific human needs.\r\n\r\nTechnology is a broad concept that deals with a species\' usage and knowledge of tools and crafts, and how it affects a species\' ability to control and adapt to its environment. In human society, it is a consequence of science and engineering, although several technological advances predate the two concepts.\r\n\r\nScience refers to a system of acquiring knowledge. This system uses observation and experimentation to describe and explain natural phenomena. The term science also refers to the organized body of knowledge people have gained using that system.\r\n\r\nFields of science are commonly classified along two major lines:\r\n\r\nNatural sciences, which study natural phenomena (including biological life),\r\nSocial sciences, which study human behavior and societies.\r\nThese groupings are empirical sciences, which means the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.\r\nâ€œthe practical applications of scienceâ€ points to the root of much of the current confusion as to the meaning of technology. In using this phrase to describe technology he effectively placed technology beneath the umbrella of science to such an extent that science and technology are now, as Rose described, seen by many as an â€œindivisible pairâ€ with technology as the subservient and dependant partner. Thus, for much of the time the pair are wrapped together into a single conceptual package known simply as â€œscienceâ€. This point is emphasised when surfing the Internet for technology-related teaching resources. A plethora of lesson plans exist at sites dedicated to science education. The problem is, though, that many of these lessons should properly be termed â€œtechnologyâ€ but are all too often referred to as \"Applied Science\".\r\n\r\nOne source of confusion is the undoubted relationship that exists between science and technology and Sparks pointed out that even though science and technology overlap in an area which might be referred to as â€œapplied scienceâ€, there are a number of important differences between the two, even though these differences might not be self-evident to an average member of the general public who, through neglect and through repeated use of the phrase â€œscience and technologyâ€ has lost the distinction between â€œscienceâ€ and between â€œtechnologyâ€.
